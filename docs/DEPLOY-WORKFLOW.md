# Deploy and sync workflow

**This doc is maintained in the Lovable repo.** It reaches the Pages repo via sync (Lovable dev -> Pages staging) and then your PR (staging -> main). Edit here only; the same file lives at **ekbatashoonya.github.io** `docs/DEPLOY-WORKFLOW.md` after you merge that PR.

## Repos and branches: where this doc lives

| Repo | Branch | How it gets there |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| **Lovable repo** (ek-bata-shoonya-portal-43-9d1ae0a6) | **dev** | You edit here. Source of truth. |
| **Pages repo** (ekbatashoonya.github.io) | **staging** | Sync merges Lovable dev -> staging, so staging gets this file. |
| **Pages repo** (ekbatashoonya.github.io) | **main** | You open a PR staging -> main and merge; main then has this file. |

Workflow YAML files (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) are split across the two repos:

- **Lovable repo**: `trigger-sync-to-pages.yml` (triggers the sync; runs only here).
- **Pages repo**: `sync-lovable.yml` (runs the sync) and `deploy.yml` (builds and deploys). These are maintained directly on the Pages repo because `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot push workflow file changes.

The sync step **strips all workflow files from Lovable** after merge so the push succeeds. App code, docs, and everything else from Lovable flows through normally.

## Where to edit what

Edit only in the place listed; other copies are either generated by sync/PR or must not be changed.

| What | Where to edit | Notes |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **Workflow: `trigger-sync-to-pages.yml`** | **Lovable repo**, **dev** branch, `.github/workflows/trigger-sync-to-pages.yml` | Only workflow in the Lovable repo. Runs when dev changes or when run manually. Do not add other workflows to the Lovable repo. |
| **Workflow: `sync-lovable.yml`** | **Pages repo**, **staging** then **main** (via PR), `.github/workflows/sync-lovable.yml` | Maintained only in the Pages repo. Edit on staging, push, then merge staging → main so main has the updated file. Sync does not overwrite this file. |
| **Workflow: `deploy.yml`** | **Pages repo**, **staging** then **main** (via PR), `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | Maintained only in the Pages repo. Edit on staging, push, then merge staging → main. Sync does not overwrite this file. |
| **Documentation** (e.g. `docs/DEPLOY-WORKFLOW.md`, any file under `docs/`) | **Lovable repo**, **dev** branch | Source of truth. Edits flow to Pages staging via sync, then to main when you merge your staging → main PR. Do not edit docs in the Pages repo; they will be overwritten on the next sync. |
| **App code** (everything else: `src/`, `public/`, `index.html`, `package.json`, config files, etc.) | **Lovable repo**, **dev** branch | Edit in Lovable (or in the Lovable repo locally). Changes flow to Pages staging via sync, then to main via your staging → main PR. Do not edit app code in the Pages repo; it will be overwritten on the next sync. |

**Summary:** Workflow YAMLs for **sync** and **deploy** live only in the **Pages repo** (staging → main). The **trigger** workflow and **all app code and docs** live in the **Lovable repo** (dev) and reach Pages via sync and your PR.

**Lock file and `npm ci`:** Staging and main get `package.json` and `package-lock.json` from Lovable dev (via sync and the PR). If deploy fails with "package.json and package-lock.json are in sync" / "Missing ... from lock file", fix it in the **Lovable repo dev** branch: run `npm install`, commit the updated `package-lock.json`, then sync so staging (and then main) receive the fix. Do not fix the lock file only in the Pages repo; the next sync would replace it.

## Version flow (website only; not .github)

Version applies only to website files. The **source of truth** is the Lovable repo **dev** branch. The same version flows through the pipeline and is shown on the live site.

| Stage | What happens |
|-------|----------------|
| **Lovable dev** | Every update to **dev** is the new “version”. No separate version file is committed in Lovable; the version is the **dev** commit that gets synced. |
| **Sync (dev → staging)** | When the sync workflow runs, it writes **version-info.json** on staging with `sourceCommit` = the Lovable **dev** commit SHA that was just merged, plus `sourceBranch`, `sourceRepo`, `updatedAt`, and `role: "staging"`. So the version updates automatically with every sync. |
| **PR (staging → main)** | **version-info.json** is part of the repo; merging the PR copies it to **main**. So **main** has the same version info that was on staging. |
| **Deploy (main → frontend)** | The deploy workflow reads **version-info.json** from **main** (it does **not** overwrite it). It sets build env from `sourceCommit` and `updatedAt`, builds the app, and writes **dist/version.json** for the site. The frontend (e.g. footer) displays this version via the same **version-info** (e.g. “main @ &lt;commit&gt; · &lt;date&gt;”). |

**Do not** edit **version-info.json** by hand in the Pages repo. It is written by the sync workflow and must flow unchanged from staging to main so the deployed site shows the correct Lovable-dev version.

## Repos involved

- **Lovable repo** = **ek-bata-shoonya-portal-43-9d1ae0a6** -- app source; you edit here in Lovable. The **dev** branch is synced into the Pages repo's **staging** branch.
- **Pages repo** = **ekbatashoonya.github.io** -- holds **staging** (updated from Lovable dev) and **main** (production). Only **main** is deployed to the live site.

## Flow summary (Lovable dev -> Pages staging -> Pages main)

The pipeline is one-way; nothing auto-promotes to production:

1. **Lovable dev -> Pages staging**: When the Lovable repo's **dev** branch changes, a sync runs and updates **only** the Pages repo's **staging** branch. The sync workflow never touches **main**.
2. **Staging = test only**: The live site is **not** deployed from **staging**. Only **main** deploys. Test staging locally (from the Pages repo: `git checkout staging && npm ci && npm run build && npm run preview`) or via a PR diff before promoting.
3. **Pages staging -> Pages main**: When you're happy with staging, open a PR from **staging** -> **main** in the Pages repo and merge. Only this manual step updates **main**.
4. **Pages main -> production**: A push to **main** triggers the deploy workflow in the Pages repo; the live site updates.

## Staging vs prod (one URL)

GitHub Pages gives **one** site per repo. So:

- **Production**: Deploy runs only on push to **main** in the Pages repo. That's the live site.
- **Staging**: Sync from Lovable updates **staging** only. The live site is never overwritten by staging.

## How Lovable -> staging sync runs

The Pages repo has a workflow **"Sync Lovable into staging"** (`sync-lovable.yml`). It runs only when:

1. **Push to dev** — The Lovable repo's workflow calls the Pages repo's `repository_dispatch` when you push to **dev**. Requires **`REPO_DISPATCH_TOKEN`** in the Lovable repo (see below).
2. **Manual** — In the Pages repo, Actions -> **"Sync Lovable into staging"** -> Run workflow.

Sync merges the Lovable repo's public **dev** branch into the Pages repo's **staging**; no token is needed in the Pages repo to read from the public Lovable repo. After merge, workflow files from Lovable are reverted so the push succeeds (`GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot push workflow changes).

### Setting up REPO_DISPATCH_TOKEN (one-time)

You need **one** token that can trigger workflow events (repository_dispatch) in **ekbatashoonya/ekbatashoonya.github.io** (the Pages repo). Create it on the GitHub account that has push access to that repo, then add it as a secret **in the Lovable repo**.

**Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token**

- **GitHub.com** -> profile (top right) -> **Settings** -> **Developer settings** -> **Personal access tokens**.
- **Fine-grained** (recommended): **Generate new token**. Name it e.g. `trigger-pages-sync`. Under **Repository access**, choose **Only select repositories** and pick **ekbatashoonya/ekbatashoonya.github.io**. Under **Permissions** -> **Repository permissions**, set **Contents** to **Read and write** (required for `POST /repos/.../dispatches`). **Actions: Read and write** alone is not enough. Generate and copy the token.
- **Tokens (classic)**: **Generate new token (classic)**. Name it, set expiry, check **repo** and **workflow** (workflow is required to trigger repository_dispatch). Generate and copy.

**Step 2: Add the token in the Lovable repo**

- In the **Lovable repo**, go to **Settings** -> **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions**.
- **New repository secret**: Name **`REPO_DISPATCH_TOKEN`**, value = token from Step 1.

**Step 3: Verify**

- Push a commit to **dev** in the Lovable repo (or run "Trigger sync to GitHub Pages repo" from Actions there).
- In the **Pages repo**, open **Actions** and confirm **"Sync Lovable into staging"** ran. If the token is wrong or missing, the trigger workflow in the Lovable repo will fail with 401/403.

**If you see 403 "Resource not accessible by personal access token"**: the token cannot call `POST /repos/.../dispatches`. Use a **classic** token with **repo** and **workflow**, or a **fine-grained** token with **Contents: Read and write** on the Pages repo (Actions: Read and write alone is not sufficient). Update the token and `REPO_DISPATCH_TOKEN` in the Lovable repo.

## Versioning (which version where)

| Where | How to see the version |
|-------|-------------------------|
| **Lovable repo, `dev`** | `git log -1 --oneline` on **dev**. |
| **Pages repo, `staging`** | **version-info.json** on the **staging** branch (`role: "staging"`, `updatedAt`, etc.). |
| **Pages repo, `main`** | **version-info.json** on **main** (`role: "production"`, `deployed: true`). |
| **Live site** | Footer version line; or **https://ekbatashoonya.github.io/version.json** (branch, commit, buildTime, deployed). |

## Testing the workflow (Lovable dev -> staging -> main -> live)

### 1. Lovable dev -> Pages staging

- **Option A:** In the **Pages repo**, Actions -> **"Sync Lovable into staging"** -> Run workflow.
- **Option B:** Push a commit to **dev** in the Lovable repo; the trigger workflow will run and the Pages sync will run.

**Verify:** In the Pages repo, **staging** branch has **version-info.json** with `"role": "staging"` and recent `updatedAt`. Optionally: from Pages repo `git checkout staging && npm ci && npm run build && npm run preview` and open the preview URL.

### 2. Pages staging -> Pages main

- In the **Pages repo**, open a **Pull request** from **staging** into **main**. Review the diff, then **merge**.

**Verify:** **main** is updated; **"Deploy to GitHub Pages"** runs.

### 3. Pages main -> live site

- After the deploy workflow completes, the live site updates.

**Verify:** Pages repo Actions -> "Deploy to GitHub Pages" success; open the site and footer version line; open **https://ekbatashoonya.github.io/version.json** and confirm `deployed: true` and branch/commit match **main**.

### Quick reference

| Step | Where | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Pages repo -> Actions, or push to Lovable dev | Run "Sync Lovable into staging" (or push to dev) |
| 2 | Pages repo | PR **staging** -> **main**, then merge |
| 3 | Automatic | Deploy runs on push to main; check live site + version.json |
