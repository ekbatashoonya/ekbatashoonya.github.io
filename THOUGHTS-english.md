# Ek Bata Shoonya: Introduction

Come, my friends. Today let us walk into a world of mathematics that some of you may have visited before, but many perhaps never truly have.

That world is **foundational mathematics**.

You might think that “basic mathematics” simply means addition, subtraction, counting, and calculation. That is certainly one way of looking at it. But that is only a surface-level acquaintance with mathematics, a handshake, a polite hello.

If you wish to build intimacy with mathematics, to embrace it, to sit with it late into the night and converse with it, and most importantly, to hear its story in its own voice, then you must turn your attention to its foundations. These are the aspects that mathematicians have carefully shaped and refined over centuries.

## 1 + 1 = 2 Was Not So Simple

Did you know that in order to logically establish that `1 + 1 = 2`, Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead wrote a monumental three-volume work titled *Principia Mathematica*?

Such depth was devoted to something that appears so simple.

This alone tells us that mathematics is not merely a game of numbers. It is the pinnacle of reasoning, structure, and clarity.

## Why Study Mathematics?

Should one study mathematics for wealth or fame? Perhaps those may come. But the true joy lies in forming a friendship with mathematics and in understanding its spirit.

Wealth and success often follow competence. And competence in mathematics does more than produce results. It builds strength, sharpens intellect, and most importantly, brings a unique kind of joy.

## The Beginning of a Journey

The history of mathematics is so vast and fascinating that every generation deserves to experience it. Yet in the routines of everyday life, we rarely find the time.

So let us begin a journey in which we explore questions that were either silenced when asked, or perhaps never asked at all.

We will discuss not only concepts, but also stories.

We will also address what is perhaps the greatest obstacle to learning mathematics today, language.

## Beyond Language

This is not merely translated content. It is written with care, with the intention that it feels authentic and reaches both heart and mind.

For now, our focus may be on Hindi-speaking learners. Gradually, we hope to expand into other languages as well.

At the foundation of Ek Bata Shoonya lies a simple but powerful idea.

- Do not be afraid of English.
- Do not run away from it.
- Embrace it.

Modern mathematics is largely written in English. To participate in it fully, we must engage with it confidently.

Our goal is that regardless of your linguistic background, you should be able not only to understand mathematics, but to engage with it deeply and eventually contribute to it.

## Exams and Understanding

Students preparing for competitive examinations often require computational or limited theoretical mathematics. But certain examinations test something deeper. They test your foundational understanding.

There, formulas are not enough. The structure of your thinking matters.

Before moving ahead, we must learn to pause and ask:

> “How did this happen? Where did this come from?”

## How Far Can You Go?

Modern mathematics is entirely human-made. That means it can be fully understood. It is not a mystical domain reserved for a select few.

You can advance far enough to one day contribute your own theory, concept, or explanation.

But to do that, two truths must be understood.

- We stand on the shoulders of giants.
- We must learn to stand shoulder to shoulder with the giants of our own time.

Along this journey, certain illusions must be broken.

The greatest illusion is this.  
**“My English is weak, so mathematics is not for me.”**

Another illusion is this.  
**“I am not good at mathematics.”**

Ek Bata Shoonya is an attempt to gently dismantle both.

We truly believe that you will join us in this journey, not merely to learn mathematics, but to live it.

See you soon.
